                <li>View classification analytics on an Admin Dashboard</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The App requires users to provide their own Anthropic (Claude) API key.</p>

            <h3>6.1 No Guarantee of Accuracy</h3>
            <p>AI-generated classifications are suggestions provided for convenience. We do not guarantee that classifications will be:</p>

            <h3>6.3 Training Data</h3>
            <p>Classification patterns learned from your tickets are stored in Forge Storage and are isolated to your Jira instance. These patterns are not shared with other customers or used to train models for other purposes.</p>
