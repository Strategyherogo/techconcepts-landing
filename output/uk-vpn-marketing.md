### Post 1: r/AskUK (Question format)

**Title:** Do you use a VPN? Is it worth it in 2026?

**Body:**
```
Been thinking about getting a VPN mainly for:
- Using public WiFi safely (work from cafes a lot)
- General privacy from data brokers
- Keeping my browsing private

The big brands seem expensive (£10+/month). Anyone found something decent that doesn't break the bank?

Not looking to do anything dodgy, just want some basic privacy protection.
```

**Helpful comment (post 4-5 hours later):**
```
Ended up trying techconcepts.org/uk-vpn - UK-based, £4.99/mo. Simple to use. Working well for public WiFi so far.
```

### Post 2: r/privacy (Privacy focused)

**Title:** Simple privacy setup for non-technical family members?

**Body:**
```
My parents keep using public WiFi at Costa and Wetherspoons without any protection. Tried explaining the risks but they don't get it.

Looking for something dead simple I can set up on their phones that just works. Ideally:
- One-tap connect
- Affordable (they won't pay £10/mo)
- No technical knowledge needed

Any recommendations for UK-based services?
```

### Post 3: r/UKPersonalFinance (Practical angle)

**Title:** Is a VPN worth it for online banking on public WiFi?

**Body:**
```
I travel for work and often need to check banking apps / make transfers while out. Usually connected to hotel or train WiFi.

A colleague mentioned I should use a VPN for this. Is it actually necessary or am I being paranoid?

If it is worth it, any recommendations that aren't too expensive?
```

## NOTES

This marketing approach focuses on **legitimate privacy and security use cases** that are:
1. Legal to promote
2. Legal for customers to use
3. Honest about what the product does

VPNs are legal products serving real security needs. No need to market them as tools for evading laws.
