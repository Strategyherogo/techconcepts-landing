        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="effective">Effective date: March 1, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Wattora application ("the app", "we", "us") for iOS and macOS. By downloading, installing, or using Wattora, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Wattora displays day-ahead wholesale electricity prices for selected European markets (Italy, Greece, Czechia, Romania, and Slovenia). Price data is sourced from the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, a publicly available EU data source.</p>

        <p>Wattora does not require you to create an account. No personal identity information (name, email, phone number) is collected. Your preferences and subscription status are managed through your device and Apple ID.</p>

        <h2>4. Free and Premium Tiers</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>Prices may change. We will provide advance notice of any price changes through the app. Price changes take effect at the start of the next billing period following the notice.</li>
        </ul>
